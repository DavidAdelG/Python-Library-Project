# Python-Library-Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive Library Management System implemented in Python. It incorporates key concepts such as syntax, object-oriented programming (OOP), graphical user interface (GUI) development, and database integration.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Utilizes Python's OOP principles for a well-organized and modular codebase. [Here](https://github.com/DavidAdelG/Python-Library-Project/blob/main/Python%20OOP.ipynb)
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Implements an intuitive GUI for easy interaction and a seamless user experience. [Here](https://github.com/DavidAdelG/Python-Library-Project/blob/main/PyQt5%20GUI.ipynb)
- **Database Integration:** Connects to a database to efficiently manage and store library data.
